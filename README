# storecoin

A casual draft hobby idea, to solve together the cryptocurrency storage and energy use problems.

# draft ideas

the below is a work in progress of how to do this, improvements desired
for now there are enough ideas below to begin forking a well-maintained coin to do this

- each network node has a private key (a wallet associated with its network behavior)
- protocol messages are signed so that proof can be offered of misbehaving peers
- each node need not store the whole blockchain, but must store at least 1 block
- blocks contain double-signed assertations from peers that other peers behaved correctly or incorrectly and demonstrated storage of so many blocks
- reward is distributed to everyone behaving fully correctly, in proportion to how much of the blockchain they are proven to store and provide
- the protocol includes moving small bits of the historical chain around that recipients either desire or already have, to verify that it is being stored and provided correctly

we can shrink the size of proofs of demonstration since they will reuse existing data
otherwise, when the blockchain is not being transferred, we only need signed assertations that peers behaved correctly, without actual packet data,
or only the signed packets demonstrating peers did not behave correctly: and only one of those is needed to prevent giving them the reward.
